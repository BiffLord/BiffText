# BiffText

## Use
This is supposed to be like Microsoft Notepad.
The point of making this is solely for education purposes, and to learn about GUI development.
This is not intended to be actually used.
I might try to make something similar to word, however, that would likely be written in JavaFx for learning purposes.
At any rate, if I do, it would be in another repo that I would add a link to here.
## The Name
...is still a work in progress.
Right now, it kind of sucks, but I'm still working on a better name

## Dependencies
I wanted to learn how to use libraries thus this requires a library.
The Library is my personal BiffLib.

## Self-made
Parts of this program were in itself. This includes:
* Printing
* Parts of this README.md
## Notes
* All, including the dependency, but the font are made by me
