# BiffText

## Use
This is supposed to be like Microsoft Notepad.
The point of making this is solely for education purposes, and to learn about GUI development.
This is not itended to be actually used.
I might try to make something similar to word, however, that might be impossible in JSwing.
At any rate, if I do, it would be in another repo that I would add a link to here.
## The Name
...is still a work in progress.
Right now, it kind of sucks but I'm still working on a better name

## Dependencies
I wanted to learn how to use libraries thus this requires a library.
The Library is my personal BiffLib.
## Notes
* All by me (including the dependency)
